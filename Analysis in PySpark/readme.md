# GitHub README for Advanced Word Count Analysis in PySpark

## 🌟 Welcome to PySpark Word Count Analysis!

Dive into the fascinating world of big data processing with PySpark! This project is an in-depth exploration of text analysis using Apache Spark, providing a hands-on experience with data manipulation and insight extraction.

### 🛠️ Setup

Get your environment ready:
1. **Install PySpark**: Follow the [PySpark installation guide](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/getting_started/install.html).
2. **Data Gathering**: Download two books from [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/). Choose texts over 100kB for intriguing results!

### 📊 Word Count Analysis

#### Basic Word Count
- Develop a PySpark program to count word frequencies.
- Output: List of key-value pairs (word and count).

#### Enhanced Word Count
- Enhancements include:
  1. Case insensitivity.
  2. Punctuation exclusion.
  3. Stop word filtering.
  4. Descending order sorting by count.

#### Analysis
- Observe the 25 most common words.
- Explore the execution stages in PySpark.
- Include screenshots of the DAG visualization from Spark's WebUI.

### 📘 Learning Resources

- Check the [RDD programming guide](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/rdd-programming-guide.html) for basics on Spark.
- CSE 4/587 Fall 2023 resources for deep dives.

### 📝 Project Analysis

Answer analytical questions based on your application results. Explore the differences in execution stages with and without the enhancements.
