# Data Analysis and Predictive Analytics Projects

## Overview

This repository houses three robust projects, each focusing on different aspects of data analysis and machine learning:

1. **Predictive Analytics Project**: Dive into machine learning with custom algorithms and Scikit-Learn pipelines, complemented by Matplotlib visualizations.
2. **Hadoop MapReduce Project**: Explore advanced text processing and analysis in Hadoop, focusing on word count applications and sophisticated data handling.
3. **PySpark Word Count Analysis**: Delve into big data processing with PySpark, offering a hands-on experience with data manipulation and insight extraction.

### üåê Predictive Analytics Project
