# GitHub README for Predictive Analytics Project

## Overview

Welcome to our Predictive Analytics Project! This project is an exciting journey into the world of machine learning and data visualization. It aims to implement algorithms from scratch and use popular Python libraries for advanced predictive modeling.

### Project Structure

- **Part 1 - Custom Machine Learning Algorithms**:
  - **K-Nearest Neighbour and K-Means Clustering**: Implemented using only NumPy and Pandas.
  - **predictive_analytics.py**: Contains all custom algorithm implementations.

- **Part 2 - Scikit-Learn Machine Learning Pipeline**:
  - **Supervised Learning Algorithms**: SVM, Logistic Regression, K-Mean, and K-NN using Scikit-learn.
  - **Ensemble Model**: A voting classifier combining the mentioned algorithms.
  - **Visualization**: Confusion matrix for each classifier, including the ensemble, using Matplotlib.

### How to Use

1. **Setup**: Ensure you have Python installed with Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, and Matplotlib.
2. **Running Scripts**: Execute `predictive_analytics.py` to see the algorithms in action.
3. **Data Input**: Feed your dataset into the script as per the format specified in the code.
4. **Visualization**: Observe the output visualizations for a comprehensive understanding of the model performances.

### Report

For a detailed explanation of the solutions and methodologies, refer to the report covers the entire workflow, from data loading to hyperparameter optimization, and includes a section on model saving/loading and performance metrics.

### Disclaimer

This project is for educational purposes. While we have strived for accuracy, the implementation might not cover all edge cases and is provided "as is".
